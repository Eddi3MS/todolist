# Todo App made with React.Js, Redux Toolkit and Framer Motion

So i made this app following Web Cifar tutorial, to learn more about redux toolkit and framer motion. It was an awesome tutorial. [Check it out!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0Uf_xu350k)

I didnt change the design - not good at it, plus Web Cifar design is amazing!! -, so its almost a clone. See it [live](https://objetivos.netlify.app/).
